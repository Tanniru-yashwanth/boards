Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{email}}
Follow the link below:
{{http}}://{{127.0.0.1}}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forgot your Boards username: {{user.username}}

If clicking the link above doesnt work, please copy and paste the url in the new browser window instead.

If you have received the mail in error, Its likely that another user entered your email address mistake while trying to
reset a password.
If you didnt intiate the request, you dont need to take any futher action and can safely disregarad this email.


Thanks,

The Boards Team
